# Pylogger
This is an super simple Keylogger i made with python. It is intented for local use, but
you can send the logs by e-mail if you wan to.

### What it does?

It registers every key you've pressed on your computer while the script was running and 
it saves an log file every 60 seconds (you can change that).

## I'm not responsible for using this code on a computer you don't have permission to, use it at your own risk!
